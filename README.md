# TITLE
Vangaurd and Digital Advisor

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

The Vanguard Group

* When was the company incorporated?

May 1, 1975

* Who are the founders of the company?

John C. Bogle

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

While studying at Princeton, Bogle conducted a research project on mutual funds.  He observed that the majority of investment funds did not actually beat the returns of the overall benchmark index.  Even if they did, fees greatly impacted returns to investors.  His key investment principles are to buy the index and to buy and hold, don't actively trade.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Vanguard is a privately owned company and is structured in that it is owned by the funds managed by the company; therefore making it owned by its customers.  As the company is privately owned, there is not a clear market capitalisation or funding figures available.  To give scope however, the company has ~$7.7 Trillion assets under management.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

I'm focusing on Vanguard's Digital Advisor -- the company's version of a robo advisor.  It is addressing the need for a low cost alternative to manage and automate a portfolio of Vanguard mutual funds and etfs as well as other products.  This is a great stop gap for those that want investment guidance but not to the extent of hiring an actual advisor.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Vanguard's intended customer is middle America.  Their goal is to bring low cost investment solutions to areas that were unreachable by the average investor.  Vanguard excels at offering low cost products in the form of low expense ratios and operating costs. 

## The company

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Per website "appsruntheworld.com": "The Vanguard Group has purchased the following applications: Microsoft Power BI for Analytics and BI in 2014, Salesforce Marketing Cloud for Marketing Automation in 2015, Microsoft Dynamics CRM for CRM in 2017 and the related IT decision-makers and key stakeholders."

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Wealth Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Accessibility in the form of apps.  Robo Advisors as highlighted here.  Also the creation and release of many new funds and financial products for investors to trade and access (Vanguard offers a total of 430 mutual funds globally).

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Vanguard's impact has been vast.  They almost single handedly brought index funds to the individual investor and have always been a proponent of low cost investing.  They are staying true to this spirit by making their Digital Advisor available.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

One key benchmark for mutual funds is the expense ratio, a measurement of cost to the investor.  Vanguard boasts an average expense ratio of 0.08% for its mutual funds and etfs, 83% lower than the industry average.  In addition as mentioned earlier, assets under management give a measurement of how large their investment portfolio is.  Vangaurd's assets under management is 7.7 Trillion as of earlier this year.  They are 2nd only to BlackRock who has somewhere in the range of $8.5 Trillion.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Vanguard is considered part of the "Big 3" for mutual fund investing along with BlackRock and State Street.  They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the 2nd largest provider of mutual funds 2nd to BlackRock.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I think a hybrid second tier to their Digital Advisor would be successful.  In this tier there could be access to a real advisor via video call.  Perhaps it's available for free quarterly and than after that priced on demand per session.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think they do a great job fulfilling a bare bones model with their current offerings in order to make a very affordable product available.  However there is still a market for those who may want additional advice or assurance.  It may be more accepted by the older demographic that is slower to adapt to a fully robo advisor model.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

As mentioned it would require video calling technology.  Vanguard could license an existing platform or build their own.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Video calls are the appropriate solution in this model as it keeps the plan fully digital and remote but allows human interaction.
